# 3 in 1 Toolbox app

This is a small project of mine to show my coding experience in SwiftUI and how I set up my GitHub for potential employers.

This app includes
* A Counter
* A Textmanipulator
* A Bill Splitter

## Counter

This app will count up or down with the press of the corresponding button.

## Textmanipulator

This app takes the text you enter and transforms it into ALL CAPS, Capitalize First Letter, or all lowercase. The transformed text can be easily copied using the button next to the text field.

## Bill Splitter

This app will split your bill among 2 to 99 people, and you can also add a tip if you wish.
